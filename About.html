<h1> CRISTY AGUILAR</h1>
<br>
<p> Cristy Aguilar is a student at San Jose State University pursuing a BFA in Digital Media. Her interests in the program range from coding (web development/design) to 3D modeling and UI/UX.
<br>
<br>

She is honored to be able to pursue a higher education as a first generation American and student.
Her work often takes inspiration from her culture and the issues as well as beauty she sees in it. Being outspoken through her work is one of the many goals Aguilar keeps in mind while creating interactive pages,
illustrations, and much more. Including themes of loved ones as well as motivation, she hopes that her work is able to bring people together through similar experiences in life. Finding common ground with those
of different backgrounds is one of her many goals.
